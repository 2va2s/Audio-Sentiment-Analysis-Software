# JPWAV-AI: 



# <p align="center">Audio Sentiment Analysis Software</p>
  
This is a project aimed at setting up an application allowing the analysis of emotions of a recorded voice based on a large set of audio data.

The repo is composed of 3 main parts: **Data Science**, **API** and **Software**.

Each part works independently and the union of those 3 parts is the **Software**.

The progress of the part devoted to the deployment of the api in *Azure* is available on this secondary repo: https://github.com/JeanPhilippeCaetano/Audio-Sentiment-Analysis-Software-Deployment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [PyQt5](https://www.qt.io/qt-for-python/)
- [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- A lot of Data Science libraries
    


## üõ†Ô∏è Install Dependencies
Go in the folder of the part that you want to run (between **Data**, **API** and **Software**) and install dependencies through the requirements.txt included in each parts.

### Software (from /Software/):

Data Science:

`Open our notebooks and have fun ;)`

The dataset used for our ML models of this project is part of ***The Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS)*** provided by [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/1188976#.ZEL6UnZByUk), huge thanks to them !

It contains 1440 files, 24 professional actors (12 female, 12 male), vocalizing two lexically-matched statements in a neutral North American accent (60 trials per actor x 24 actors). Speech emotions includes calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprise, and disgust expressions. Each expression is produced at two levels of emotional intensity (normal, strong), with an additional neutral expression.
